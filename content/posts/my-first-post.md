Hey there, I'm Shrivaths S Nair, and I call the town of Palakkad in Kerala my home. I'm a college student, currently studying Computer Science Engineering. One of my greatest joys in life is diving into the world of books, and my all-time favorite is "Who Moved My Cheese." When I'm not buried in code or books, you'll likely find me outdoors, playing games with friends. Coding is not just a subject for me, it's a passion I love to explore. Stick around, and let's journey through my world together!
