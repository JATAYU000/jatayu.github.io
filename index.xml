      <description>Creating a Hugo server was easy. I followed the website&amp;rsquo;s procedure. Adding a post was straightforward too. For the themes part, I scrolled through the Hugo themes page but didn&amp;rsquo;t find what I was looking for. Then, I found a simple yet pretty theme, Hugo-ink, and git-cloned its theme repository. I made all the changes to suit my needs, like fonts, colors, icons, etc. Hosting was a bit challenging because I initially tried a workflow method from the Hugo Git page, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>Hey there, I&amp;rsquo;m Shrivaths S Nair, and I call the town of Palakkad in Kerala my home. I&amp;rsquo;m a college student, currently studying Computer Science Engineering. One of my greatest joys in life is diving into the world of books, and my all-time favorite is &amp;ldquo;Who Moved My Cheese.&amp;rdquo; When I&amp;rsquo;m not buried in code or books, you&amp;rsquo;ll likely find me outdoors, playing games with friends. Coding is not just a subject for me, it&amp;rsquo;s a passion I love to explore.</description>
